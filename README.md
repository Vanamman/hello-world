# hello-world

Hello all!

My name is Tim and I am learning how to use GitHub. I've always been curious about programming and have dabbled in it ever since I was 14 years old. I've always worked for a couple of weeks then stopped and come back a few months later. I want to keep myself committed to learning to program, and eventually make a career out of it.
